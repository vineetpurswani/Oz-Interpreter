Questions Attempted - all

Question 1 -------------------------------------------
Multistack is implemented with the given specifications as provided in the question. A modified version of Oz's queue's library is implemented to make the implementation of multistack easy. 
Every stack runs until it is finished or it uncounters an unbound variable. In first case the empty stack is popped from the multistack and another stack which is in ready state is run. In the second case the current stack which has uncountered an unbound variable is again pushed into the multistack and other ready stack is run. The program terminates if the multistack is empty that means all threads are succesfully completed or every thread stack is in suspended state.
